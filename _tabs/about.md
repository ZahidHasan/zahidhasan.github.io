## 🔬Decoding Life's Algorithms

Reconciling Code with Biology — How Machine Learning Deciphers Genomic Puzzles, Powers Next‑Gen Drug Discovery, and Redefines Tomorrow's Technologies.
My goal is to leverage my background in Statistics and Machine Learning (honed during my research fellowship at Salzburg University, Austria) and my Masters in Software Technology from the University of Trento, Italy to contribute to the evolving field of BioInformatics.

I combine BioInformatics expertise with software development skills — designing pipelines, building scalable applications, and crafting intuitive tools that transform raw biological data into actionable insights. I am dedicated to using computational innovation to decode life’s complexity, seeking answers to the very ailments that change human lives.
Dive into expert analyses, code walkthroughs, and frontier innovations where biology meets technology.
