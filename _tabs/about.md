## From Computer Science to Bioinformatics: A Journey of Resilience

I am Zahid Hasan, a former Assistant Professor of Computer Science and a researcher in Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) and Machine Learning. Following a period of profound personal loss and a subsequent neurological journey with hippocampal sclerosis, I have redefined my path.

**"Where code meets curiosity"** is no longer just a tagline; it is my roadmap for turning life's hardest challenges into a new scientific passion.

### 🧬 My New Frontier: Bioinformatics

My goal is to leverage my background in **Statistics** and **Machine Learning** (honed during my research fellowship at Salzburg University) and my **Masters in HCI from Italy** to contribute to the field of **Bioinformatics**. I am dedicated to using computational tools to decode biological data, seeking answers to the very ailments that change human lives.

### 🛠 Technical Expertise

Despite the hurdles of dementia and recovery, my foundational knowledge in CSE remains my strongest tool. I am currently focusing on:

* **Computational Biology:** Applying ML models to genomic data.
* **Data Science:** Advanced statistics and data visualization (Python/R).
* **Software Engineering:** Building accessible, high-performance tools for researchers.

### 🔬 Current Focus: Bioinformatics Transition

I am currently applying my background in Machine Learning and Statistics to the field of Computational Biology.

* **Currently Learning:** Molecular Biology fundamentals & Biopython.
* **Next Milestone:** Sequence Alignment Algorithms & NCBI Data Mining.
* **Status:** Open to collaborative research and open-source contributions.

### 🤝 Let’s Collaborate

Whether as a specialized freelancer or a research collaborator, I bring a unique perspective that combines high-level academic experience with the grit of a survivor. 

> "I believe that the intersection of biology and computer science holds the key to the next generation of healing. I am here to be a part of that discovery."
