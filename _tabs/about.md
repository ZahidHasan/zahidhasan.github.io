## 👋 Hello, I'm Zahid Hasan

**Where code meets curiosity.** I am a Software Engineer who spends as much time looking at source code as I do wondering about the mechanics of the universe. This blog is a collection of my thoughts, tutorials, and experiments at the intersection of **technology** and **science**.

### 💻 What I Do

My primary focus is on building robust, scalable software. I specialize in:

* **Modern Web Technologies:** Crafting interfaces and backends that perform.
* **Version Control:** Deep dives into Git to make collaboration seamless.
* **System Architecture:** Designing logic that lasts.

### 🌌 Why the Curiosity?

I've always found that programming concepts become clearer when compared to the physical world. Whether it's comparing state management to quantum states or Git branching to parallel universes, I love finding the "physics" inside the code.

### 📬 Get in Touch

I'm always down for a good technical (or philosophical) chat.
