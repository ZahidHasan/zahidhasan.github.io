## 🔬 Exploring Cutting-Edge Science: Passionate about Bioinformatics, AI, Modern Physics, and —always diving deep into emerging tech!

I am Zahid Hasan — a computer scientist, educator, and researcher whose journey spans **Bioinformatics**, **Human-Computer Interaction (HCI)**, **Machine Learning**, and now the expanding frontier of **computational sciences**. My career began as an Assistant Professor of Computer Science, where I combined teaching with research in usability and intelligent systems. Over time, personal challenges reshaped my perspective, but also deepened my resolve to use technology as a tool for resilience and discovery.

**"Where code meets curiosity"** reflects my drive to bridge disciplines and turn challenges into innovation.

## 🧬 My New Frontier: Bioinformatics

My goal is to leverage my background in **Statistics** and **Machine Learning** (honed during my research fellowship at **Salzburg University,Autria**) and my **Masters in HCI from niversity of Trento, Italy** to contribute to the field of **Bioinformatics**. I am dedicated to using computational tools to decode biological data, seeking answers to the very ailments that change human lives.

## 🔭 Othrs Areas of Interests

- **Human-Computer Interaction:** Designing systems that prioritize usability, accessibility, and human-centered design.  
- **Machine Learning & Data Science:** Applying statistical models and algorithms to uncover insights across domains.
